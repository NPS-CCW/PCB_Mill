PCB Mill FAQs
Q: How do I ensure that the bottom left corner of the board is at the origin?
A: Make all layers of the board visible using the "Layer" selection menu.  Using the "Group" tool, select all elements of your board design (including documentation markings).  Once the elements are selected, type "move (>0 0) (dx dy)" into the command line, where (dx, dy) is the shift needed to bring the corner to the true origin.  Be sure to verify the needed shift by using hovering your cursor over the board corner before entering the command.
